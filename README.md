# Pattern for Universal Protocols (PUP)

Drafts of the PUP specification are available in the [draft](draft)
directory.  Each draft is mutually exclusive of the others, and each
draft is a standalone specification, though possibly incomplete.  The
drafts are numbered based on the lineage of their creation: `pup-1.md`
is the parent of `pup-1.1.md` and `pup-1.2.md`, and `pup-2.md` was
created independently of `pup-1.md`, etc.  The numbers represent no
other significance or preference.
